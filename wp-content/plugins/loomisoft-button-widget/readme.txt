== Description ==
Loomisoft's Button Widget plugin provides a widget that allows you to place highly customisable link buttons in your sidebars, footers and other widgetised areas. The plugin is designed to be very intuitive and simple, but provides a huge amount of flexibility and versatility in defining the button's text, background, borders, paddings and hover characteristics, making it easy to fit in with the look and feel of the website.

Available from WordPress.org or directly through your WordPress site's administrative pages, this plugin is provided completely free of charge so you can take advantage of all the benefits it has to offer.

= Features =
Using a very simple to operate form interface, the widget allows each button to be fully customised, including:

* Button text
* Link address (and whether to open in a new browser window)
* Button alignment within containing area (full width, center, left or right)
* Font family (including thousands of Google fonts)
* Font size and line height
* Text color, bold, italic and underline (normal and mouse hover)
* Background color (normal and mouse hover)
* Border width and radius
* Border color (normal and mouse hover)
* Paddings & margins

Colors may be set using the provided color pickers or RGB hex values

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Are buttons easy to add and edit? =

Yes. They can be added into any of the sidebars in your WordPress website's widget administration page under "Appearance" > "Widgets". Once added, each button can be customised for your needs.

= Can buttons be placed within the body of a page/post or other areas? =
Buttons are currently only designed to be placed in widgetised areas (e.g. sidebars, footers, etc.). However, some page builder plugins do allow widgets/widget sections to be included in the body of the page (content area).
